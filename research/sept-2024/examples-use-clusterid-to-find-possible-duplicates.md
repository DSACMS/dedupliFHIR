# Examples: Use cluster_id to find possible duplicates

We will link to this page from the DedupliFHIR success page, which shows after a user downloads a results file (i.e., a file that has been deduplicated). 

Content to come. 

Notes: 

The results spreadsheet adds 2 new columns to each row of your patient records data: 

* unique_id: identifies a specific patient record
* cluster_id: identifies a cluster of duplicates


To see records with the same cluster_id: 

1. Open the spreadsheet and select the cluster_id column.
2. In the “Data” menu, select “AutoFilter.”
3. Click the arrow at the top of the cluster_id column.
4. Select a cluster_id from the list.

You’ll see a list of records with the same fundamental source of information (for example, a patient or provider).
